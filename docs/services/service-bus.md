# Service Bus

Azure Service Bus emulation with a **management plane** for entity topology (queues, topics,
subscriptions) over HTTP, and an **AMQP 1.0 data plane** backed by an Apache ActiveMQ Artemis sidecar
managed automatically by floci-az.

| Plane | Protocol | Transport | Port |
|---|---|---|---|
| Management | HTTP | `/{account}-servicebus/` on `:4577` | `4577` |
| Data | AMQP 1.0 | Apache ActiveMQ Artemis sidecar | `5673` (AMQP) / `5674` (AMQPS) |

Entity topology is created dynamically through the management API (or auto-created on first use by
the SDK), and can additionally be **pre-provisioned declaratively** from a `Config.json` file in the
official Service Bus emulator's format — see [Declarative topology](#declarative-topology-configjson).

> **Mocked mode (default).** With `mocked: true` the Artemis sidecar is not started: the management
> API responds, but the AMQP data plane is unavailable. Set `mocked: false` (and expose the AMQP
> ports) to send and receive messages.

## Management plane

Entity CRUD is served over HTTP at `/{account}-servicebus/`:

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/{account}-servicebus/$Resources/queues` | List queues |
| `PUT` / `DELETE` | `/{account}-servicebus/{queue}` | Create / delete a queue |
| `GET` | `/{account}-servicebus/$Resources/topics` | List topics |
| `PUT` / `DELETE` | `/{account}-servicebus/{topic}` | Create / delete a topic |
| `GET` | `/{account}-servicebus/{topic}/subscriptions` | List subscriptions |
| `PUT` / `GET` / `DELETE` | `/{account}-servicebus/{topic}/subscriptions/{sub}` | Manage a subscription |
| `GET` | `/{account}-servicebus/{topic}/subscriptions/{sub}/rules` | List subscription rules |
| `PUT` / `GET` / `DELETE` | `/{account}-servicebus/{topic}/subscriptions/{sub}/rules/{rule}` | Manage a subscription rule |

## Declarative topology (Config.json)

At startup, floci-az applies a declarative topology file in the
[official Service Bus emulator's `Config.json` format](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/test-locally-with-service-bus-emulator)
— the same file .NET Aspire's Service Bus hosting integration writes from the AppHost model. The
file location is resolved in order:

1. `floci-az.services.service-bus.topology-file` (env `FLOCI_AZ_SERVICES_SERVICE_BUS_TOPOLOGY_FILE`)
2. `/ServiceBus_Emulator/ConfigFiles/Config.json` — the official emulator's mount path, so a volume
   prepared for the official emulator works unchanged

```yaml
services:
  floci-az:
    image: floci/floci-az:latest
    volumes:
      - ./Config.json:/ServiceBus_Emulator/ConfigFiles/Config.json:ro
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
```

Namespaces, queues, topics, subscriptions, and rules from the file are created through the same
code paths as the management API, before any client connects — useful for apps whose consumers
attach to pre-provisioned entities and never create them. Semantics:

- The first namespace binds the configured AMQP ports (`amqp-port`/`amqp-tls-port`); the official
  emulator supports a single namespace, and additional namespaces get dynamic ports.
- A discovered topology file takes precedence over `start-on-boot`; its first namespace owns the
  configured ports, and no separate `default` namespace is started.
- A subscription with declared `Rules` gets exactly those rules — the implicit `$Default`
  TrueFilter is removed, as in the official emulator. A subscription with no rules keeps `$Default`.
- Rule replacement is atomic. If a reload of an existing subscription contains an invalid rule,
  its previous complete rule set remains active; a new subscription keeps only valid declarations.
- Entity properties honor the same validation as the management API (`LockDuration` ≤ `PT5M`,
  `MaxDeliveryCount` 1–2000, duplicate-detection window `PT20S`–`P7D`).
- `ForwardTo`/`ForwardDeadLetteredMessagesTo` are not emulated and log a warning if present.
- Loading is best-effort: an invalid entity is skipped with an `ERROR` log and the rest of the
  topology still loads; a missing or unparsable file never fails startup.

## Subscription rules and filters

Subscriptions filter which topic messages they receive through named **rules**, matching Azure
semantics:

- Every new subscription starts with the implicit **`$Default`** rule (a `TrueFilter` that accepts
  everything). The usual SDK flow — add your real rule, then delete `$Default` — works as on Azure,
  as does passing a `DefaultRuleDescription` in the subscription create body
  (`CreateSubscriptionAsync(subscriptionOptions, ruleOptions)`).
- **`CorrelationFilter`** — exact-match (case-sensitive) AND-combination over `CorrelationId`,
  `Label`/`Subject`, `SessionId`, and application properties.
- **`SqlFilter`** — SQL92 expressions over application properties and `sys.CorrelationId`,
  `sys.Label`, `sys.Subject`, `sys.SessionId` (including `LIKE`, `IN`, `BETWEEN`, `IS NULL`,
  `EXISTS(prop)`, arithmetic and boolean operators).
- **`TrueFilter`** / **`FalseFilter`** — accept-all / accept-none.
- Multiple rules combine as a logical **OR** and deliver a **single** copy of a matching message.
  A subscription whose rules have all been deleted receives nothing.

Filters compile to [Artemis queue selectors](https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/documentation/latest/filter-expressions.html),
so evaluation happens inside the broker at routing time — messages that don't match a
subscription's rules are never routed to it (no delivery-count inflation, no spurious
dead-lettering).

**Emulator deviations from Azure:**

- Filters on `MessageId`, `To`, `ReplyTo`, `ReplyToSessionId`, or `ContentType` (and their `sys.*`
  forms) are **rejected with HTTP 400** — these AMQP fields have no broker-side selector mapping.
- **Rule actions** (`SqlRuleAction`) are stored and echoed back by the management API but are
  **not applied** to delivered messages, and rules with actions do not produce extra message
  copies.
- Property names in filters are case-sensitive and must be valid selector identifiers
  (letters, digits, `_`, `$`). Correlation-filter values typed `int`/`long`/`double`/`boolean`
  etc. compare with their declared type; other non-string types compare as strings.
- Rule changes update the subscription's filter in place (messages already routed to the
  subscription stay, receivers stay attached) and, as on Azure, apply to future messages only.
- If persisting a rule change fails, the emulator retries restoring the previous broker filter
  and returns HTTP 500. If every rollback attempt fails, it logs the inconsistency and leaves
  the broker running to preserve queued messages and client connections. The broker filter
  may then differ from stored rules until a later successful rule update reconciles them.

## Message sessions

Queues and subscriptions created with `RequiresSession` support Azure SDK session receivers.
Set `SessionId` on sent messages, then use a specific-session receiver, an accept-next-session
receiver, or a session processor. The broker translates Azure's AMQP session filter into an
Artemis `JMSXGroupID` selector, which keeps each session on one receiver and preserves FIFO order
within that session. Attach responses include Azure's `com.microsoft:locked-until-utc` property.

Session ownership lasts for the receiver link. Session state and explicit session-lock renewal are
not currently emulated.

Read a session-enabled entity's dead-letter subqueue with an ordinary receiver. Azure SDKs do not
expose session receivers for dead-letter subqueues, and receiving from that subqueue does not
require a session lock.

## Message peeking

Queue and subscription receivers support Azure SDK `peekMessages()` calls through each entity's
AMQP `$management` node. Peeking preserves message bodies, system properties, and application
properties; supports `maxMessages` and `fromSequenceNumber`; and does not lock, remove, or change
delivery count. Each call returns at most Azure's 250-message limit and may return fewer messages
when needed to keep the AMQP response bounded. Empty entities return an empty result.

## Connection String

```
Endpoint=sb://localhost:5673;SharedAccessKeyName=RootManageSharedAccessKey;SharedAccessKey=devkey;UseDevelopmentEmulator=true;
```

`UseDevelopmentEmulator=true` tells the SDK to use plain AMQP (no TLS). The `SharedAccessKey` value is
ignored — Artemis runs without authentication in dev mode.

## Deterministic endpoint for orchestrators

The AMQP data plane always binds the configured host ports (`amqp-port`, default `5673`;
`amqp-tls-port`, default `5674`), so an orchestrator that starts floci-az knows the Service Bus
endpoint up front — there is no dynamic port to discover. Two more pieces complete the story:

- **`start-on-boot: true`** starts the `default` namespace (and its Artemis sidecar) together with
  the emulator, instead of on the first entity-management call. Without it, nothing listens on the
  AMQP port until a queue, topic, or namespace is created, which breaks health checks and clients
  that connect at startup.
- **`GET /{account}-servicebus/namespaces`** reports each running namespace's actual
  `amqpPort`/`amqpsPort`, for tooling that wants to verify or discover the endpoint at runtime.

This is what hosting integrations (e.g. .NET Aspire) should rely on: pass
`FLOCI_AZ_SERVICES_SERVICE_BUS_AMQP_PORT` (with `..._MOCKED=false` and `..._START_ON_BOOT=true`),
then hand clients `Endpoint=sb://<host>:<that port>;...;UseDevelopmentEmulator=true;`.

## Python SDK

```python
from azure.servicebus import ServiceBusClient, ServiceBusMessage

CONN = (
    "Endpoint=sb://localhost:5673;"
    "SharedAccessKeyName=RootManageSharedAccessKey;"
    "SharedAccessKey=devkey;"
    "UseDevelopmentEmulator=true;"
)

with ServiceBusClient.from_connection_string(CONN) as client:
    with client.get_queue_sender("myqueue") as sender:
        sender.send_messages(ServiceBusMessage("hello world"))

    with client.get_queue_receiver("myqueue", max_wait_time=5) as receiver:
        for msg in receiver:
            print(str(msg))
            receiver.complete_message(msg)
```

## .NET SDK

```csharp
await using var client = new ServiceBusClient(
    "Endpoint=sb://localhost:5673;SharedAccessKeyName=RootManageSharedAccessKey;" +
    "SharedAccessKey=devkey;UseDevelopmentEmulator=true;");
ServiceBusSender sender = client.CreateSender("myqueue");
await sender.SendMessageAsync(new ServiceBusMessage("hello world"));
```

The Artemis sidecar includes the `MSSBCBS` anonymous SASL mechanism expected by
`Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus`; authorization continues through the standard CBS link.

### application.yml

```yaml
floci-az:
  services:
    service-bus:
      enabled: true
      mocked: true              # true = management plane only, no Docker. false = real Artemis sidecar
      start-on-boot: false      # true = default namespace starts when no topology file is discovered
      amqp-port: 5673
      amqp-tls-port: 5674
      artemis-image: "apache/activemq-artemis:2.44.0"
      max-delivery-count: 10      # default when the entity omits MaxDeliveryCount
      lock-duration-seconds: 60   # default when the entity omits LockDuration
```

### Per-entity delivery settings

Queues and subscriptions honor `MaxDeliveryCount` (1–2000) and `LockDuration`
(up to `PT5M`) from the entity-create payload, matching Azure. A message is
dead-lettered once its delivery count exceeds the entity's `MaxDeliveryCount`.
`LockDuration` is enforced for session locks and individual non-session
peek-lock deliveries, including dead-letter queues. Expired messages become
available to other receivers while the original receiver remains open; late
settlement returns `MessageLockLost`. Entities that omit either property fall
back to the configured defaults above.

## Received message metadata

Received messages expose broker-assigned `SequenceNumber` and `EnqueuedTime`, matching peek
for the same message in the same entity. This includes session receivers, dead-letter queues,
`ReceiveAndDelete`, and streamed large messages. Abandon and lock-expiry redelivery preserve
both values; dead-lettering preserves the original enqueue timestamp.

Sequence numbers use Artemis broker message IDs, as peek already does. They may contain gaps,
and moving a message to a dead-letter queue may assign a new ID. Azure's gap-free per-entity
sequence allocation is not emulated.

## Out of scope (future work)

- Session state and explicit session-lock renewal
- Explicit message-lock renewal
- Deferred messages and auto-forwarding
- Message transactions
- Geo-disaster recovery and partitioned entities
